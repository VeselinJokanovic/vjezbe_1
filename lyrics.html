        <h4 id="1_pjesma"><i>Bless the Child</i></h4>
        <br>
        <p><i><pre>I was born amidst the purple waterfalls
            I was weak, yet not unblessed
            Dead to the world
            Alive for the journey
            One night I dreamt a white rose withering
            A newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness
            I dreamt all my future. Relived my past
            I witnessed the beauty of the beast
            Where have all the feelings gone?
            Why has all the laughter ceased?
            Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
            Gone back in time to bless the child
            How can I ever feel again?
            Given the chance would I return?
            Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
            Gone back in time to bless the child
            Think of me long enough to make a memory
            Come bless the child one more time
            I've never felt so alone in my life
            As I drank from a cup which was counting my time
            There's a poison drop in this cup of man
            To drink it is to follow the left hand path
            Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
            Gone back in time to bless the child
            Think of me long enough to make a memory
            Come bless the child one more time
            Think of me long enough to make a memory
            Come bless the child one more time
            Where have all the feelings gone?
            Why is the deadliest sin,
            To love as I loved you?
            Now unblessed, homesick in time,
            Soon to be freed from care, from human pain
            My tale is the most bitter truth
            Time pays us but with earth & dust
            And a dark, silent grave.
            Remember, my child
            Without innocence the cross is only iron,
            Hope is only an illusion
            And the ocean soul's
            Nothing but a name
            The child bless thee
            And keep thee forever</pre></i></p>
        <h4 id="2_pjesma"><i>War Eternal</i></h4>
        <br>
        <p><i><pre>Friend or foe?
            There's no way to know
            Through the battlefield of life
            It's kill or be killed
            So many times
            It's a matter of degree
            From being up on your luck
            To down on your knees
            It's a hellish inferno
            This is war eternal
            They try to change you
            Crush and break you
            Try to tell you what to do
            They'd like to have control of you
            Back against the wall
            In danger of losing it all
            Search deep inside
            Remember who you are
            It's times like these
            When lines are drawn
            Which side of the fence
            Are you standing on?
            There will come a day
            Not so far away
            When the hunter
            Becomes the prey
            It's a hellish inferno
            This is war eternal
            They try to change you
            Crush and break you
            Try to tell you what to do
            They'd like to have control of you
            Back against the wall
            In danger of losing it all
            Search deep inside
            Remember who you are
            This is fucking war!
            They try to change you
            Crush and break you
            Try to tell you what to do
            They'd like to have control of you
            Back against the wall
            In danger of losing it all
            Search deep inside

            Now exposing bone
            From the darkness

        <br>
        <p><i><pre>I am a man who walks alone
            And when I'm walking a dark road
            At night or strolling through the park
            When the light begins to change
            I sometimes feel a little strange
            A little anxious when it's dark
            Fear of the dark
            Fear of the dark
            I have a constant fear that something's always near
            Fear of the dark
            Fear of the dark
            I have a phobia that someone's always there
            Have you run your fingers down the wall
            And have you felt your neck skin crawl
            When you're searching for the light?
            Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
            At the corner of the room
            You've sensed that something's watching you
            Fear of the dark
            Fear of the dark
            I have a constant fear that something's always near

            Fear of the dark
            Have a phobia that someone's always there
            Have you ever been alone at night
            Thought you heard footsteps behind
            And turned around and no one's there?
            And as you quicken up your pace
            You find it hard to look again
            Because you're sure there's someone there

            Fear of the dark
            Watching horror films the night before
            Debating witches and folklore
            The unknown troubles on your mind
            Maybe your mind is playing tricks
            You sense and suddenly eyes fix
            On dancing shadows from behind
            Fear of the dark
            Fear of the dark

        <h4 id="5_pjesma"><i>Stairway to Heaven</i></h4>
        <p><i><pre>There's a lady who's sure
            All that glitters is gold
            And she's buying a stairway to heaven
            When she gets there she knows
            If the stores are all closed
            With a word she can get what she came for
            Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
            And she's buying a stairway to heaven
            There's a sign on the wall
            But she wants to be sure
            'Cause you know, sometimes words have two meanings
            In a tree by the brook
            There's a songbird who sings
            Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
            Ooh, it makes me wonder
            Ooh, it makes me wonder
            There's a feeling I get
            When I look to the west
            And my spirit is crying for leaving
            In my thoughts I have seen
            Rings of smoke through the trees
            And the voices of those who stand looking
            Ooh, it makes me wonder
            Ooh, it really makes me wonder
            And it's whispered that soon
            If we all call the tune
            Then the piper will lead us to reason
            And a new day will dawn
            For those who stand long
            And the forests will echo with laughter
            Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, oh-oh
            If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
            It's just a spring clean for the May Queen
            Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
            And there's still time to change the road you're on
            And it makes me wonder
            Oh, whoa
            Your head is humming and it won't go
            In case you don't know
            The piper's calling you to join him
            Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
            And did you know
            Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
            And as we wind on down the road
            Our shadows taller than our soul
            There walks a lady we all know
            Who shines white light and wants to show
            How everything still turns to gold
            And if you listen very hard
            The tune will come to you at last
            When all are one and one is all, yeah
            To be a rock and not to roll
            And she's buying a stairway to heaven</pre></i></p>
